Description: <br>
I started playing MTA when I was 9 years old. I enjoyed it a lot because there were endless things to do, endless goals to achieve. At 11 years old I was so amazed by the scripts on different servers. I decided that I wanted to replicate those scripts. I knew it was possible, I wanted to remake it and make it better. That's how I started scripting. I wanted to be the best. I wanted to beat everyone that ever scripted for MTA. It was a far fetched goal but not out of my reach. When I turned 16 I met a guy who had been scripting for a long time. His name is Tails. Tails scripted a lot longer that I did. I asked him to teach me things that he knew. I learned quite fast, generally what he knew I knew because I learned it all within a few months. We decided to work together, to build something that would change MTA forever. Something that would change the way people make scripts. We wanted to make an impact. So before I was banned from MTA completely, we made a beta script. A single script, to load all the rest in the most efficient and flexible way possible. We made it so that you can instantly transfer data without the use of events or exports or element data. We made it so that client side files could be downloaded from the closest servers so that people in different countries could experience fast download speeds. Scripts load in a flash and they communicate like nothing ever seen before.
<br>
I was banned from MTA for continuously getting aggressive with the communities staff members. I claimed that I was being defensive against insults and contradictive and or derogatory commentary. The community simply wasn't a place for my behavior.
<br>
I'm releasing this script for the people of MTA. I wanted to change MTA, here's how I'm doing it. I hope that scripters can find use in this script and or optimize it even further. Good luck to all of you scripters out there.
